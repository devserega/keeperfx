PE/DLL Rebuilder of Export Section (PeRESec)
-------------------------------

This program rewrites export section in a DLL file,
using a .MAP file to get new exports.

It works with all DLL files which have PE header.

It may be used to make more/less exports in a .DLL
 file if its source code is not available. It can
 also be used to help changing EXE file into DLL.

warning:
 This program may damage your DLL file; make backup
  before using it! There's no guarantee it will work.

legal:
 Please note that licence agreement of many commercial
  programs prohibits modification to the code.
 Check the product licence agreement before using
  it on program for which you don't own copyrights.

usage:
    peresec.exe [options] <filename>
where <filename> should be the input PE file, and [options] are:
    -v,--verbose             Verbose console output mode
    -o<file>,--output<file>  Output file name
    -n<text>,--modname<text> Module name for export table
    -m<file>,--map<file>     Input .MAP file name
    -f<file>,--def<file>     Output .DEF file name
    -p<text>,--prefix<text>  Function names prefix

input files:
    .DLL and .MAP files

output files:
    .DLL and .DEF files

The program clears previous export table in .DLL file
 and replaces it with new one, made using entries from
 .MAP file.

The .MAP file is generated by many compilers, but also
 some disassemblers can make it, for example IDA Pro.

Generated .DEF file may be needed to compile programs
 which uses the DLL. Not all compilers require .DEF
 file, but most of them do.

example map file:
 The map file is a text file which defines one export
  table entry per line. Here is an example of one-line
  file (only one entry exported):
<CUT HERE>
 0001:000DBE80       WinMain@16
<CUT HERE>
 As you can see, the structure of every line is:
 seg:offset          function_name

Note that format of the function_name may be different
 for functions compiled with various calling conventions.
For example __stdcall comes in the format same as above:
 name@args. But __cdecl should be named without arguments.

Version: 1.0.8
 Some of the messages are now shown only in verbose mode
 Better auto-creation of export module name
 Module name can be changed from command line
 If export section doesn't exist, it is now auto-created

Version: 1.0.7
 Code divided into more functions
 More of the processing takes place in memory
 New command line parameters parser
 More command line parameters available

Version: 1.0.6
 Better management of the section space
 Displays information about usage of section space
 Versioning system updated
 Fixed exports sorting algorithm issue

Version: 1.0.5
 Works with all PE-based DLLs
 Project renamed to PeRESec

Version: 1.0.4
 Completely updates section header
 Rewrites whole section, fills unused space with 0
 Fixed mistake in free space checking

Version: 1.0.0
 Rebuilds names, ordinals and offsets
 Works with KeeperFX only
 Project name is KeeperFX_EC

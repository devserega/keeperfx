#summary generate a new translation

=I want to add a translation for a campaign=

These instructions assume that an English version of the campaign file is available, and that the target language is already a KeeperFX language.  You will need [POEdit] software to do this.

Go [http://code.google.com/p/keeperfx/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fkeeperfx%2Flang%253Fstate%253Dclosed here]  and you will see a list of the language files for the original campaign. Click on the file of the language you wish to use. Then right-click on ‘save target as’, and download the file ‘gtext_xxx.po’ (where xxx is the language you wish to translate into).

Similarly, download the .pot file for the campaign you wish to translate. If it is an official campaign within KeeperFX go [http://code.google.com/p/keeperfx/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fkeeperfx%2Flang here] (and expand the folder view on the left hand pane) and download the file. If it is an unofficial file, then you’ll need to have the English template (.pot) file from the author(s).

Open the file in POEdit. From within the program choose

Catalogue>update from pot file

POEdit will now have highlighted all the campaign specific messages that need the new language scripts. Translate into the new language, and save the file as a new .po file 

(for example ‘akpr_rus.po’)

When the file is completed, e-mail it to Mefistotelis (see contact information [http://keeper.lubiki.pl/html/contact.php here]) for inclusion in the campaign.

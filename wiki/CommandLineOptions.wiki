#summary Command Line Options for Keeper FX

= Introduction =

This page displays the command line options available in the most recent release of Keeper FX.

= Details =

-nointro
  The intro sequence won't play at startup.
-nocd
  The CD Sound tracks won't play.
-1player
  Allows playing multiplayer maps in skirmish mode.
  This is normally ON, so the option has no effect.
-nosound or -s
  Disables all the sounds.
-fps _num_
  Changes the game speed; default _num_ is 20.
-usersfont
  Disable the AWE32/64 SoundFonts (.SBK files).
-alex
  Used to show the 'JLW' easter egg. And not only that.
-level _num_
  Brings you directly to level number _num_.
  After the level is finished, quits the game.
  Note that level number must be 1..65534.
-human _num_
  Changes human player to _num_. This option will
  work properly only in skirmish mode. Single player
  levels must be specially designed for this option
  to work. Also, the selected player must have
  heart on the map.
-q
  Works like '-level 1'.
-columnconvert
  I assume it converts the columns data. Watch out with
  this one or you may be unable to play the game again.
-lightconvert
  Same thing, but for lights.
-vidsmooth
  Smoothes the 3D view using 1-pixel bilinear blur.
  This consumes more CPU, and the effect is merely visible,
  so blurring is disabled by default.
-altinput
  Uses alternate mouse input method. This changes the way of
  computing mouse position; with this option, position is not
  reset to screen center every time movement is detected.
  May be helpful if original method isn't working right
  (ie. mouse stops).
-packetsave _filename_
  Writes a packet file (replay file) when playing.
  After using this option, you must start a new level
  (or use '-level' parameter). Saved replay will work
  properly as long as you won't change any of the game
  files. Even a minor change in map or configuration
  may make the replay invalid.
-packetload _filename_
  Loads a previously created packet file. Starts the
  level for which packet file was created, and continues
  the gameplay. You may exit this mode by pressing
  Alt+X, or take over the control by pressing ALT+T.
  Note that this option is experimental, and packet files
  may sometimes not work as intended.
-sessions _hostname1:port;hostname2:port;etc_
  Adds sessions to the TCP/IP session list. _hostname_
  is either a DNS name or an IPv4 address (the latter ought
  to be far more common).

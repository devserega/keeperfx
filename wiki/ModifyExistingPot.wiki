While .po file have a great tool to create, update and edit them, the .pot files do not have such editor. The best way is to open them in your favourite text editor and make changes there.

Remember to use simple text editor, which will not support text formatting, and will not break syntax of the .pot file. Notepad or MadEdit are both a good choice; don't use Ms Word.

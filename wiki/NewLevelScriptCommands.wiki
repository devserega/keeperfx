#summary New and Modified Level Script Commands

= Introduction =

Level script commands that have a new or different meaning to Keeper FX can be found here.

= Details =

ADD_GOLD_TO_PLAYER
  Allows to add some off-map gold as a reward to a player.
  Example: ADD_GOLD_TO_PLAYER(PLAYER0,5000)
ALLY_PLAYERS
  KeeperFX uses an extra parameter, allowing alliances to be
  turned on and off in the script (1=on, 0=off)
  Example: ALLY_PLAYERS(PLAYER1,PLAYER2,1)
  (Note: if you enable KeeperFX commands with LEVEL_VERSION
  old 'ally_players' commands without the extra parameter
  will no longer work. Add a '1' or '0' to fix this)
BONUS_LEVEL_TIME
  Sets time to be displayed on "bonus timer" - on-screen
  time field, used mostly for bonus levels.
  Like in original DK, this command accepts one parameter
  - number of game turns to start the countdown from.
  But now this command can be used to show bonus timer in
  any level. Setting game turns to 0 will hide the timer.
  Example: BONUS_LEVEL_TIME(12000)
DISPLAY_OBJECTIVE
  The 2nd parameter can now have the following values:
  - 'PLAYERx' - zoom to player's dungeon heart
  - positive integer - zoom to Action Point of given number
  - negative integer - zoom to Hero Gate of given number
  - 'ALL_PLAYERS' - zoom button will be inactive
LEVEL_VERSION
  Lets the game know if the level was designed specially for
  KeeperFX. To use new script commands, you must start the
  script with LEVEL_VERSION(1). Without it, the new commands
  will not work properly.
PLAY_MESSAGE
  Allows to play any SOUND or SPEECH from the game.
  Example: PLAY_MESSAGE(PLAYER0,SPEECH,107)
QUICK_INFORMATION
  These works same as in Deeper Dungeons, but allows message
  length up to 1024 characters. There are 50 quick message
  slots.
QUICK_OBJECTIVE
  Same as in DD, but allows longer messages and more control
  over zoom button (like in DISPLAY_OBJECTIVE).
QUICK_INFORMATION_WITH_POS
QUICK_OBJECTIVE_WITH_POS
  Accepts additional XY coordinates of the zoom place.
SET_CREATURE_TENDENCIES
  Allows to set tendencies: IMPRISON and FLEE, for a player's
  creatures. Example: SET_CREATURE_TENDENCIES(PLAYER2,FLEE,1)
  Note that a player must have prison when IMPRISON command
  is trigered; otherwise it won't make any change.
REVEAL_MAP_RECT
  Reveals rectangular map area for given player. Requires
  coordinates of area center point, and rectangle dimensions.
  Numbers are scaled in subtiles (range is 1..254).
  Example: REVEAL_MAP_RECT(PLAYER0,132,96,13,11)
REVEAL_MAP_LOCATION
  Reveals square area of subtiles around given location.
  Location meaning is identical to the one in DISPLAY_OBJECTIVE.
  For example, to reveal Hero Gate no.1:
  REVEAL_MAP_LOCATION(PLAYER0,-1,11)
RESEARCH
  Changes amount of research points needed to discover an item
  in library. It doesn't affect research order, only amount
  of points. If the item never was in research list, it's added
  at end. Example: RESEARCH(PLAYER1,MAGIC,POWER_CHICKEN,10000)
RESEARCH_ORDER
  When this command is first called, the research list for
  specified players is cleared. Using it you may create
  a research list from beginning. Note that if you won't place
  an item on the list, it will not be possible to research it.
  So if you're using this command, you must add all items
  available on the level to the research list. Example:
   RESEARCH_ORDER(ALL_PLAYERS,ROOM,SCAVENGER,50000)
   [...] - more RESEARCH_ORDER commands should follow.
RANDOM
  It's not a command, but may be used instead of most parameters.
  If used instead of a number, then should look like:
  RANDOM(min,max)
  but may also be used instead of any other value. Examples:
    MAX_CREATURES(PLAYER0,RANDOM(12,19))
    ADD_CREATURE_TO_POOL(RANDOM,20)
  Note that when used instead of player name, RANDOM may return
  ALL_PLAYERS. Also, the command shouldn't be used in multiplayer
  maps, as it will lead to synchronization problems.
  Value represented by RANDOM is selected at start of a map,
  and never changes during the gameplay.
